# Delegated registration and login

Same as the [NextJS example](../nextjs-delegated/), this example demonstrates how to build a complete client/server solution integrating with DFNS API on the server side and WebAuthn for client authentication. This approach is for clients who want to delegate custody of wallet assets to their users.

This implementation uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) for the API server and [ReactJS](https://create-react-app.dev/) for the SPA client.
